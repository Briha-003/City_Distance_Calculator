# City_Distance_Calculator
This Java program calculates the distance between two cities on Earth given their latitude and longitude coordinates. It provides a simple yet effective way to compute the distance in kilometers or miles based on user input.

# Overview
The CityDistanceCalculator uses the Haversine formula to determine the distance between two points on the Earth's surface specified by their latitude and longitude. It allows users to input the coordinates of two cities and choose the unit of distance (kilometers or miles) to calculate the geographical distance between them.

# Features
User Interaction: Accepts latitude and longitude values for two cities and the desired unit of distance.
Accurate Calculations: Utilizes the Haversine formula for precise distance calculations on a spherical Earth model.
Unit Flexibility: Supports distance calculations in both kilometers and miles based on user preference.

# Usage
Input: Enter the latitude and longitude of two cities in degrees.

Unit Selection: Choose the desired unit of distance ('K' for kilometers, 'M' for miles).

Output: Displays the calculated distance between the two cities in the specified unit.
